<h2>Difference between errors and exceptions</h2>
<li><b>Errors</b> refer to any abnormal situations or conditions that prevent a program from executing successfully. They can occur due to syntax mistakes (syntax errors) or logical flaws (runtime errors). Errors typically cause the program to halt and display an error message.</li>

<li><b>Exceptions</b> on the other hand, are events that occur during program execution and disrupt the normal flow. They are a mechanism in Python to handle errors or exceptional situations gracefully. When an exception is raised, it can be caught and processed, allowing the program to respond to the error and continue execution, if desired.</li>
