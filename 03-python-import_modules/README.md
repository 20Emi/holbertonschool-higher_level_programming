<h3>What is a function?</h3>
<p>
  A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from elsewhere in the program. Some key features of Python functions are:

<li>They are defined with the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses that can contain arguments.</li>

<li>They can have optional arguments with default values.</li>

<li>They can have return values using the return keyword.</li>

<li>They allow to organize and modularize the code, which facilitates its reuse and maintenance.</li>

<li>They help improve code readability by dividing it into smaller, more focused parts.</li>

<li>They can be invoked or called from other parts of the program, passing the necessary arguments.</li>

<h5>Example</h5>
<pre>
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
    <i># Calling the function and assigning the result to a variable</i>
result = sum(3, 5)
print(result) 
  <i> # Print 8</i>
</pre>
